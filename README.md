# goSorting

The purpose of this repository is to contain different implementations of sort algorithms.

Using different arrays []int, it evaluates the correct ordering of the result of each algorithm, as well as the efficiency of each one.

# Architecture

See the package [algorithms](https://github.com/LDiegoM/goSorting/blob/main/sorting/README.md) for additional information about the different implementations

# Changelog

    - Bubble sorting
    - Insertion sorting
    - Selection sorting

## 2021-06-19
